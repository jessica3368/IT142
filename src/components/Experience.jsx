          <div className="description">The company manages alumni records for Western Mindanao State University, focusing on maintaining and providing access to graduates’ credentials. Currently, the process is manual and time-consuming, requiring alumni to visit both the registrar and the alumni office, often causing delays. The proposed alumni system aims to streamline this by allowing students to access their records online, making the process faster, more efficient, and convenient for both staff and graduates.</div>
